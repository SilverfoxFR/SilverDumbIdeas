# SilverDumbIdeas
The dumbest ideas I got will be in the root's directories. There's no purpose to whatever will be there, except existing for fun.
Testing and exploring how computers handle programs beyond "normal" and "formal"
What do I mean by "dumbest ideas" ? You can expect :
  - Asm flash-able/Qemu executable (Target architecture will be indicated or self-explanatory)
  - Crashes
  - Throwaway programs (any language can be here- Even stuff like Brainfuck)
  - Mini-games of some kind (Earthbound-style)
  - More crashes
  - Weird challenges (who'd even try to add an audio header on a txt's hexcode)
  - Low-level madness
  - Even weirder game supports (Except it's not JUST Doom)
  - WebPages being anything but a normal webpage
  - Starwalker
  - Rule 86 of Internet
  - Polyglot files (sometimes a polyglot file, made out of polyglots, etc)
  - Fails AND FINALLY... crashes.

If any of them interest you, mind the credits in your project's README :D
