# SilverDumbIdeas
The dumbest ideas I got will be in the root's directories. There's no purpose to whatever will be there, except existing for fun.
What do I mean by "dumbest ideas" ? Well, you can expect :
  - Asm flash-able/Qemu executable (Target architecture will be indicated or self-explanatory)
  - Crashes
  - Throwaway programs (any language can be here- Even stuff like Brainfuck)
  - Mini-games of some kind
  - More crashes
  - Even weirder challenges (idk- who'd even try to add an audio header on a txt's hexcode ?)
  - Low-level madness
  - Weirder game supports
  - WebPages being anything but a normal webpage
  - Starwalker
  - Rule 86 of Internet
  - Polyglot files (like, a polyglot file, made out of polyglots, etc etc)
  - Fails AND FINALLY... crashes.

If any of them interest you, mind the credits in your project's README :D
