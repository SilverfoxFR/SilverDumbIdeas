So I'm definitely NOT certain of what I'll be doing there, but I'll keep it simple--
Polyglot files are VERY special : 
  - Can be played, seen, or executed in various ways.. Or even the three of these options if done right.
  - Of course, the fancy "ooh I'm everything at the same time" thing does not come from thin air, you have to fuse at least two files together
  - I use the "cat" command (cat file1.ext1 file2.ext2 > mashedFile.ext1) to do it if y'all are curious
  - They do NOT have any particular advantage (except in malwares, but I'm chill dw)- Polyglot files are just like modern art with trash content mashed together, it's here for the heck of it
  - Some file formas/extensions may not accept to have foreign code next to theirs, and will crash (choose wisely !)
  - However, if you want to append a specific file and know it will CRASH or just not work, you can turn your problematic file into a .zip and THEN "cat" it into the target file.
  - I may or may not will create small games out of it
  - Any damage or harm will certainly not be from these files-- Except if you somehow mess up bootable USB flashing...?

That's it for the explanation byee
